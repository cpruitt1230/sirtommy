1. Compile the code
   1) mvn compile
   2) Maven put the .class files in target/classes/edu/worcester/cs/kwurst/cs242/
   3) The other directories created were
      target/maven-status/maven-compiler-plugin/compile/default-compile/.
      Inside this directory were 2 .lst files, createdFiles.lst and inputFiles.lst.
      
2. Run the tests
   1) mvn test
   2) Maven put the .class file in target/test-classes/edu/worcester/cd/kwurst/cs242/.
   3) The other directories created were
      #1: target/maven-status/maven-compiler-plugin/testCompile/default-testCompile/
      	  -> Inside this directory were 2 .lst files, createdFiles.lst and inputFiles.lst.
      #2: target/surfire-reports/
      	  -> Inside this directory were a .txt file and a .xml file,
	     edu.worcester.cs.kwurst.cs242.CardTest.txt and
	     TEST-edu.worcester.cs.kwurst.cs242.CardTest.xml.

3. Make a jar file.
   1) mvn package
   2) Maven put the Jar file in target/.
   3) The other directories created were target/maven-archiver/. Inside this directory
      was a file named pom.properties.

4. Clean up the project.
   1) mvn clean
   2) The directory target/ and everything inside of it was removed from my project
      directory.

5. Make a web site for the project.
   1) mvn site
   2) Maven put the site directory in target/.
   3) I used project-info.html.
   4) The other directories created were:
      #1: target/site/css/
      	  -> Inside this directory were 4 .css files; maven-base.css, maven-theme.css,
	     print.css, and site.css.
      #2: target/images/
      	  -> Inside here were various .gif and .png files relating to the html files in
	     target/site/.
      #3: taget/images/logos/
      	  -> Inside here were three maven .png files relating to the html files in
	     target/site/.
   5) Cosidering that there was no .jar file created after running the mvn site command
      I dont believe that the code was compiled.

6. Make a jar file again. -> mvn package
